On The Map for Udacity iOS Developer NanoDegree

This app allows a Udacity student to view the geographic location of other students and to add their own geographic instance.

The app also allows a student to add a link to their prefered website to their annotation.

The app has two primary views; a map view and a table view. 

In the map view the user can view the current annotations of the last 100 students to add their details. Tapping on the arrow in the annotation will open the default browser to the student's
provided website.

In the table view the user can view a list of the last 100 students to add their details. Tapping on the pin icon will find that student on the map and tapping on the arrow button will open the default browser to the student's provided website.

Both of the above views have several action buttons on the right side of the navbar. Tapping on the "+" icon will allow the student to add their own information to the database. The view offers either the option to use the user's current location or to search for location by string. Tapping the refresh button will refresh and reload the view with the most recent database object.

The map view has an additonal magnifying glass button. Tapping the button will find the student's current location on the map if they have location services enabled for the app.
